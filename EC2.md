  - Baseline costs also vary by region
  - Regulatory compliance in regards(data privacy)
2. Turn off your instances when they are not in use (especially for testing and staging situations)
3. Instance type;EC2 instances come in many types and you can utilize the list at(ec2instances.info) to check on costs and features
4. Instance number limitation;have default limits on number of EC2 instances per account
